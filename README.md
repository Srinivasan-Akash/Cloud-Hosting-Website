## ü§î What i have learnt By working on this project
1. Before tackleing this project i usually tried to copy paste `box-shadow` property in css now understood how it works
2. Improved in mimicing any project
3. Became an expert in `::after` and `::before` classes
4. Got to know about ASCII & Unicode's

## üòå Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 33min. This project made me understand how to make an image as a background (as displaying the whole image). But later i found it looks fine the either way (displaying image partially)
